Thanks for helping keep this list useful. Adding a tool takes about two minutes.

## Adding a tool

Open a PR that adds one line to the relevant category in `README.md`, in this exact format:

```markdown
- **[Tool Name](https://example.com)** — One factual sentence on what it does and who it's for. `PricingTag`
```

Rules:

- **Alphabetical order within the category.** CI checks this automatically — if your PR fails the check, just re-sort and push again. It's not a judgment on the tool.
- **One pricing tag**, exactly one of: `` `Free` ``, `` `Freemium` ``, or `` `Paid` ``. If the vendor only offers custom/enterprise pricing with no public number, use `` `Paid` `` and add `(enterprise/custom pricing)` after it.
- **Description ≤ 160 characters**, factual, no superlatives ("best," "revolutionary," "leading"). Say what it does and who uses it.
- **One tool per PR is preferred** (easier to review), but not required.
- Don't add yourself/your own product without disclosing it in the PR description — that's fine, we just want to know.

## What gets a tool rejected

- Not a live product (waitlist, "coming soon," defunct, or the link 404s).
- No pricing information anywhere, public or sales-gated (we need *some* signal, even "contact sales").
- Not actually specific to law or legal work — a generic tool with one tangential legal use case doesn't qualify.
- Already listed (check the category first).

## Suggesting a new category

Categories are meant to track real legal workflows, not generic tech buckets. [Open a "Suggest a category" issue](../../issues/new/choose) explaining what workflow it covers and why it doesn't fit an existing category.

## Reporting a dead link

[Open a "Report broken link" issue](../../issues/new/choose), or just fix it yourself in a PR — removals are welcome.

## Review

PRs are reviewed by the repo's [CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS). CI runs a formatting/lint check and a link check automatically; a green check doesn't guarantee a merge, but a red one means it needs another look before anyone reviews it.
